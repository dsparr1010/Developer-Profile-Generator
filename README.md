# Developer-Profile-Generator

Intro : 
    I created a command-line application that dynamically generates a PDF profile from a user provided GitHub username.The application features HTML, Bootstrap CSS Frameworks, Javascript/jQuery, NodeJS. The application runs outside the browser. Elements of the html page are responsive and html converts to a PDF file.

Features : 
    Bootstrap 4 was used to create elements and format much of the html page. Utilizing NodeJS, packages are required to be installed to run application. Upon successful installation of required packages, user is prompted to type a color and a GitHub username in the terminal.  

    Javascript/jQuery, and object oriented programming was used to create application. An object constructor function is used as a blueprint to contain the specified information of GitHub user's profile. Featuring an asynchronous function (to execute post user input), an axios call to receive information is made, followed by a second axios call to receive information regarding user's starred repositories, and an instance is made. Application features an html to PDF conversion. Application executes code outside of the browser on the NodeJS runtime environment.
